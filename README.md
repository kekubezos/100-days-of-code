This is the README file for the 100 Days of Code journey. 
A summary of projects for each day will be posted here. 
Stay tuned.

DAY 1
Developed a program that generated the name of  a band by asking the user for the city they grew in and the name of a pet.

This uses string concatenation, variables, input() and print() functions

DAY 2
Developed a program that calculates tip. The program asks for the total bill you want to pay , how many people to split the bill and what percentage tip you want to give.
It then calculates how much each person should pay.
